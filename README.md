# MLR RSS
This code updates the MLR OOTC's Play by Play script currently hosted at https://github.com/MLROOTC/MLR-OOTC/tree/main/Python%20Scripts/Play%20by%20Play . This update includes the following:
- multiple team feeds through the same file instance
- pinging of users when their at-bat is posted
- ignoring of the bot's results posts

All of the above are optional changes, and the feed can be set to operate just like the OOTC's current version.

Future upgrades will include:
- low-timer notifications to both the batter and GMs
- pitcher notification
- ability to be used for other leagues
